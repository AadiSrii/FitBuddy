                        <p>Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do for your health. Being <br /> physically active can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, <br /> strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities.
                            <br /><br />
                            Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefits. Only a few lifestyle choices have as large an impact on your health as physical activity.
                            <br /><br />
                            Everyone can experience the health benefits of physical activity â€“ age, abilities, ethnicity, shape, or size do not matter.</p>

                        <p>Regular physical activity can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and metabolic <br /> syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is some combination of too much fat around the waist, high blood <br /> pressure, low high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol, high triglycerides, or high blood sugar. <br /> <br /> People start to see benefits at levels from physical activity even without meeting the <br /> recommendations for 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity. Additional amounts of <br /> physical activity seem to lower risk even more.</p>

                        <p>Muscle-strengthening activities like lifting weights can help you increase or maintain your muscle <br /> mass  and strength. This is important for older adults who experience reduced muscle mass and  <br /> muscle strength with aging. Slowly increasing the amount of weight and number of repetitions you <br />   do as  part of muscle strengthening activities will give you even more benefits, no matter your age.</p>
